    <h1>Our Revenue Model</h1>

    <a href = "/"><button> Main Page </button> </a>

    <p>We expect our product to sell at about $100 fixed price per unit, bringing us around $50 profit, assuming that we can sell enough units per month to ignore the server hosting charges. Assuming less than a cent per unit would allows us to negate the monthly server hosting charge, we would need to sell more than 5000 units per month to make $50 profit per unit netting us about $250,000 per month before manufacturing and labor fees. Since I work for free, rest of my team will be able to split that among the 4 of them which would be $62,500 per person, which is about $750,000 a year, which isn't too bad, although kind of shabby for our CEO, senior developer, senior frontend developer, and database engineer. This is very unfeasible, and if we sell around 500 units per month, netting us $25,000 to split between 4, which would be $6,250, or $75,000 per year per person, which is not too terrible for a start up of 5 people. Leaving out other profits and losses, since they would cancel each other out for simplicity purposes. We are currently not explicitly planning a subscription fee, as those can be annoying, but it is in talks with the marketing executives (also our entire team). We may advertise on the application, which a customer may be able pay to turn off, a classic free to play mobile game tactic. We could also sell personal data, as that has very much become a norm in these days, but we wish to not have to go that far to produce a profit, as we love our customers much more than we love $$$.</p>
