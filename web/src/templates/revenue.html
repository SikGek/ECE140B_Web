    <h1>Our Revenue Model</h1>

    <a href = "/"><button> Main Page </button> </a>

    <p>We expect our product to sell at about $100 fixed price per unit, bringing us around $50 profit, assuming that we can sell enough units per month to ignore the server hosting charges. Assuming less than a cent per unit would allows us to negate the monthly server hosting charge, we would need to sell more than 500 units per month to make $50 profit per unit netting us about $25,000 per month before manufacturing and labor fees. Since I work for free, rest of my team will be able to split that among the 4 of them which would be $6,250 per person, which is about $70,000 a year, which isn't too bad, although kind of shabby for our CEO, senior developer, senior frontend developer, and database engineer. We are currently not explicitly planning a subscription fee, as those can be annoying, but it is in talks with the marketing executives (also our entire team). We may advertise on the application, which a customer may be able pay to turn off, a classic free to play mobile game tactic. We could also sell personal data, as that has very much become a norm in these days, but we wish to not have to go that far to produce a profit, as we love our customers much more than we love $$$.</p>
