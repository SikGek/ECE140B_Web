    <h1>Our Product Costs</h1>

    <a href = "/"><button> Main Page </button> </a>

    <p>The cost to build our product includes:</p>
    <li>
        <ul>Camera to capture the items going into the fridge - $17</ul>
        <ul>Contact sensor to detect fridge door opening and closing - $4</ul>
        <ul>MCU for running our program for detecting items, Pi/Pi Pico/Pi Zero - $5-$25</ul>
    </li>

    <p>Monthly costs:</p>
    <li>
        <ul>Labor for developing and marketing - I will work for free, I don't know the hourly wage for my teammates.</ul>
        <ul>Manufacturing - For now, we will hand make this product and deliver them to your doorsteps. I would, once again, work for free, but shipping cost is estimated to be around $10 per product.</ul>
    </li>
