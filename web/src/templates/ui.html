    <h1>Our UI Idea~</h1>

    <a href = "/"><button> Main Page </button> </a>

    <p>In my projected UI, we will have a contact sensor on the fridge door which will communicate to the camera when the fridge door is open. When it is open, it will begin to scan for items. As the owner puts in items into the fridge it will scan until the door is closed. When the door is closed, it will send the footage divided into images, with one image per unique item scanned, to our server which will classify it using website classification api. Then it will send the labels to our database which will update the owner in live time.</p>

	<p> My projected UI: </p>
	<img src="images/UI.jpg" alt = "our_ui" width = "800" height = "500"/> </img>
