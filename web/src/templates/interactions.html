    <h1>Key Product Interactions</h1>

    <p>Key Product design our users will have with our product will be usability-driven. The most difficult part of our users' interaction with our product is going to be the initial set up, where they will have to install the camera on top of their fridge and take a calibration photo. Other than that however, one of our primary focuses with our product was to design a product that the user doesn't have to interact with aside from the initial set up to get its benefits from. For example, the user's items will be scanned and queried while the user puts in items into the fridge as normal. And our app will be designed to show the user only the useful information, like item name, date it was put in, and number of that item remaining in the fridge. This helps the user complete the main task of the product, which is querying items into the app with no additional effort, since all the user has to do is organize items in the fridge as usual and will have the information ready for them anywhere they go. We really wanted to make sure that the user could just forget about the product after the initial installation but have the app ready at any time.</p>
